# Unity-Twitter

# Package Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i12UkVcS4MZ1Rtng9Y0aZwmX4orNgokD/view?usp=sharing
# Supported unity: 5.6 and above.

# This example uses twitters services through its API calls, so I have created a small package which implements some of the API calls such as:

# authenticating through twitter with a pin
# posting tweet on twitter
# searching a user on twitter
# sending direct message to a user
# searching a hashtag on twitter.

# To implement twitter in unity, create an app on https://apps.twitter.com/ , with filling out app name,description, website (any website) etc.
# After app has been created get the consumer key and consumer key secret from the "Keys and access Tokens" section of your app.
# Modify app permissions to "Read, Write and Access direct messages".
# Place the consumer key and consumer key secret in DemoClass.cs placed on Demo Object in scene and you are good to go.

# Note:
# All instructions to use package has been clearified in package in form of help texts.
# As I have mentioned before, I have only implemented few main api calls, if further need to implement other calls arises, visit https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index.html to get all api references and implement just like I have implemented api calls in DemoClass.cs and twitter.cs.
